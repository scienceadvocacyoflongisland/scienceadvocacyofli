Evidence-based lessons of opioid addiction can save a generation of Long Islanders. Addiction is a biological phenomenon, and those afflicted should have access to the same kind of medical and professional treatments offered for most modern day illnesses. National Institute of Health researchers have discovered that addiction hijacks, rewires, and destroys key brain regions that help us distinguish pleasure from danger.

Expert panelists discussed ways, supported by science, to prevent and slow the current opioid epidemic gripping Long Island. 

**Panelists included:**

- **[Dr. Jeffrey Reynolds, Ph.D](https://www.familyandchildrens.org/administration/jeffrey-l-reynolds/),** President & CEO of [Family and Children's Association](https://www.familyandchildrens.org/), who is on the Executive Committee of the [Nassau County Heroin Prevention Task Force](http://heroinprevention.com/) and believes that evidence-based prevention programs are critical to support young people in recovery.
- **[Peter Goldstein, RPh ](https://www.linkedin.com/in/peter-goldstein-rph-a4bb4a116/)**,who is committed to promoting the value of effective patient counseling and raising awareness about the dangers of opioid addiction.
- **Detective Sergeant James Cerone,** [Suffolk County Police Department](http://suffolkpd.org/), who has worked as a narcotics detective and spent several years addressing the opioid epidemic and prescription diversion.
