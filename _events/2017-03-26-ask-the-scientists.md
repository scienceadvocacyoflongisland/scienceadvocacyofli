Our first public event, Ask the Scientists, was held on Sunday, March 26 at the Suffolk Y JCC. We were supported by Action Together Long Island (ATLI), a group that works to bring about change through awareness and activism. Our goal was to begin to build communication between scientists and the community. We wanted to hear questions and concerns from our friends and neighbors about science-related issues so that we, the scientists, can help address them.

We watched a wonderful short video called "[Science Fuels Humanity](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rg5Fgb6mtp4)" created by [SciAll](https://sciall.org) It describes how science underlies nearly every part of modern life, and how each of us engage with it every day.

We covered many topics and we'd like to highlight some of the main discussion here. We didn't have time to get to all of the questions, but we are working to get answers to those we didn't get to and to provide links to valuable resources [on our website]() in the near future

If you still have questions we haven't answered, feel free to email them to info@scienceadvocacyli.org. Our team of scientists is happy to answer them!

1. The process of science
   - Scientists constantly evaluate evidence, which continues to change and improve with new technologies.
   - Conclusions may change depending on new supporting evidence.
   - Science is self-correcting over time.
2. Politics & science
   - Call your representatives about issues that you're worried about. To find your representatives' contact information, [click here](https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials).
   - There is a critical need for research funding.
   - Think about how science impacts you directly.
   - Support basic research from the top-down (privately funded research institutions) or from the bottom-up (STEM education in schools).
3. How to evaluate reliable information
   - Improve communication between scientists & the public.
   - Learn how to identify reliable information & misinformation: determine if the article is peer-reviewed, look at multiple sources, check references, and even contact the authors with questions.
   - Remember that funding sources must always be disclosed, and even privately funded research undergoes rigorous peer-review process by experts and continues to be evaluated by scientists in the field long after publication.
   - If it looks like 'click-bait' — it probably is!
   - Call out unreliable information being shared on social media.
   - Always think critically, especially when extremely strong words are used (this is "catastrophic!" or this is the new "cure" for cancer!)
   - Remember a lot of fields are very complex — sometimes the experts are in agreement but many times they are not. There is a huge body of literature for many subjects, so one single paper may not be enough to draw conclusions from.
   - SALI will work to compile a reliable list of resources.
   - Ask a lot of questions — reach out to your friendly neighborhood scientists :-)
