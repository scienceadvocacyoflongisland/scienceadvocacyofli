On June 10th, SALI participated in the [Eastern Long Island Mini Maker Faire](http://easternlongisland.makerfaire.com) at the [Maritime Explorium](http://maritimeexplorium.org) in Port Jefferson, NY. The Maker Faire is a gathering of fascinating, curious people who enjoy learning and who love sharing what they can do. From engineers to artists to scientists to crafters, Maker Faire is a venue for these "makers" to show hobbies, experiments, projects.

Our very own Jaclyn Novatt participated in the science caf√© with a talk entitled "From CSHL to CVS: the story of Spinraza, a new drug to treat Spinal Muscular Atrophy."

We thank everyone who was involved!
