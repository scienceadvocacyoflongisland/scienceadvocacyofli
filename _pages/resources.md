For many Americans, we are as close to a scientist as they will get, and they invite us into their living rooms.

# Genetics and Evolution

Genetics is the study of genes, genetic variation, and heredity — how the characteristics of living things are transmitted from one generation to the next. **Evolution** is the change in the heritable characteristics of biological populations over successive generations. Evolutionary processes give rise to tremendous biodiversity of species, individual organisms, and molecules.

- **[Evolution: Darwin Day](http://darwindaytn.org/) at the the University of Tennessee**
  Darwin Day in Knoxville, Tennessee is a volunteer-run event dedicated to informing the public about evolution and its importance as a unifying concept in all of biology. Our goal is to disseminate factual information, in the context of a non-confrontational and rational discussion based on empirical evidence without pre-conceived ideological agendas or uncritical faith in the opinions of scientists, politicians, or clerics. In a state with past and recent legislative efforts to introduce faith-based ideologies into the science classrooms of public schools, these efforts are particularly important.
- **[Genetic Literacy Project](https://www.geneticliteracyproject.org/)**

# Genetic Engineering, Food, and Farming

Genetic Engineering (GE), also called Genetic Modification (GM), is the direct manipulation of an organism's genome using biotechnology.

  Genetically engineered (GE) crops were first introduced commercially in the 1990s. After two decades of production, some groups and individuals remain critical of the technology based on their concerns about possible adverse effects on human health, the environment, and ethical considerations. At the same time, others are concerned that the technology is not reaching its potential to improve human health and the environment because of stringent regulations and reduced public funding to develop products offering more benefits to society. While the debate about these and other questions related to the genetic engineering techniques of the first 20 years goes on, emerging genetic-engineering technologies are adding new complexities to the conversation.
- **[Genetically Modified (GM) Plants: Questions and Answers](https://royalsociety.org/topics-policy/projects/gm-plants/)** - The [Royal Society](https://royalsociety.org/)
  What are genetically modified (GM) plants? Is genetic modification safe? Where are GM crops grown and eaten?
- Food security is one of this century's key global challenges, as noted in our earlier report Reaping the Benefits, and due to the scale of the challenge, we should really think carefully before we rule out any technology that might help deal with the problem. The questions and answers given here are intended to provide a resource to those who are interested in what GM is, how it is used and potential future uses.
- **[GMO Answers](https://gmoanswers.com/)\***
  Genetically modified organisms — GMOs — are a major topic of discussion today. Across our society, media and the Internet, a growing number of people have shared a wide range of questions and emotions on the topic — ranging from excitement and optimism to skepticism and even fear. GMO Answers was created to do a better job answering your questions — no matter what they are — about GMOs. The biotech industry stands 100 percent behind the health and safety of the GM crops on the market today, but we acknowledge that we haven't done the best job communicating about them — what they are, how they are made, what the safety data says. This website is the beginning of a new conversation among everyone who cares about how our food is grown.
