  Genetically engineered (GE) crops were first introduced commercially in the 1990s. After two decades of production, some groups and individuals remain critical of the technology based on their concerns about possible adverse effects on human health, the environment, and ethical considerations. At the same time, others are concerned that the technology is not reaching its potential to improve human health and the environment because of stringent regulations and reduced public funding to develop products offering more benefits to society. While the debate about these and other questions related to the genetic engineering techniques of the first 20 years goes on, emerging genetic-engineering technologies are adding new complexities to the conversation.

## Radiofrequency

Radiofrequency (RF) is any of the electromagnetic wave frequencies that lie in the range extending from around 3 kHz to 300 GHz, which include those frequencies used for communications or radar signals. RF usually refers to electrical rather than mechanical oscillations. However, mechanical RF systems do exist (ie mechanical filter and RF MEMS).

Although radiofrequency is a rate of oscillation, the term "radiofrequency" or its abbreviation "RF" are used as a synonym for radio — i.e., to describe the use of wireless communication, as opposed to communication via electric wires. Examples include Radiofrequency identification or SO/IEC 14443-2 Radiofrequency power and signal interface

Foster](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/directory/profile.php?ID=29), [Department of Bioengineering](http://www.be.seas.upenn.edu/), [University of Pennsylvania](http://scienceadvocacyli.org/resources/radiofrequency/www.upenn.edu/), [World Health Organization (WHO)](http://www.who.int/)
  This Conference is entitled "Criteria for EMF Standards Harmonization". Harmonization, used in the present context, is the process of reducing the large discrepancies in EMF exposure standards that are in effect throughout the world.
- **[Potential Health Effects of Exposure to Electromagnetic Fields (EMF)](https://ec.europa.eu/health/scientific_committees/emerging/docs/scenihr_o_041.pdf)** - (PDF), Scientific Committee on Emerging an d Newly Identified Health Risks (SCENIHR)
  Update to the the January 2009 SCENIHR opinions "Health effects of exposure to EMF" and July 2009 "Research needs and methodology to address the remaining knowledge gaps on the potential health effects of EMF" with the latest information and to give special consideration to areas where important knowledge gaps were identified in the previous Opinion. In addition, biophysical interaction mechanisms and the potential role of co-exposures to environmental stressors are discussed.
- **[IARC Press Release: Cell Phones a Possible Carcinogen?](http://www.emfandhealth.com/WHO Bulletin.html)** - [EMF & Health](http://www.emfandhealth.com/)
  A lot has happened in the past year since IARC issued its report in which it classified cell phones as possibly carcinogenic. We have written a comprehensive update on this report entitled: Are Cell Phones a Possible Carcinogen? An Update on the IARC Report, which is posted on the web site Science Based Medicine. In short the article explains how the evidence on which IARC based its assessment was weak to begin with. It also includes the results of new papers published over the past year that substantially undermine this already weak evidence.
- **[Radiation and Your Health: The Electromagnetic Spectrum](https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/radiation/nonionizing_radiation.html)** - [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)](https://www.cdc.gov/)
  Radiation exists all around us, from both natural and manmade sources, and is in two forms: ionizing and non-ionizing radiation. Non-ionizing radiation exists all around us from many sources. It is to the left of ionizing radiation on the electromagnetic spectrum. Examples include: Radiofrequency (RF) radiation used in many broadcast and communications applications, Microwaves used in the home kitchen, Infrared radiation used in heat lamps, Ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun and tanning beds.
- **[Radiation-Emitting Products: Current Research Results](https://www.fda.gov/radiation-emittingproducts/radiationemittingproductsandprocedures/homebusinessandentertainment/cellphones/ucm116335.htm)** - [US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.fda.gov/)
  Is there a connection between certain health problems and exposure to radiofrequency fields via cell phone use? The results of most studies conducted to date indicate that there is not. In addition, attempts to replicate and confirm the few studies that did show a connection have failed.
- **[The Sun and Other Types of Radiation: Cellular Phone Towers](https://www.cancer.org/cancer/cancer-causes/radiation-exposure/cellular-phone-towers.html)** - [American Cancer Society](https://www.cancer.org/)
  Some people have expressed concern that living, working, or going to school near a cell phone tower might increase the risk of cancer or other health problems. At this time, there is very little evidence to support this idea. In theory, there are some important points that would argue against cellular phone towers being able to cause cancer.

## Vaccines

A vaccine is a biological preparation that provides active acquired immunity to a particular disease. A vaccine typically contains an agent that resembles a disease-causing microorganism and is often made from weakened or killed forms of the microbe, its toxins or one of its surface proteins. The agent stimulates the body's immune system to recognize the agent as a threat, destroy it, and recognize and destroy any of these microorganisms that it later encounters.

- **[Debunking Common Myths](http://vaccine.fyi/author/dawnrp/)** - [Vaccine FYI](http://vaccine.fyi/)
  Science-based information about vaccines. Counteracting the rampant misinformation about vaccines published online, so that you can make the confident decision to vaccinate yourself, your children, and your pets. Vaccines are safe, effective, and necessary.
- **[History of Vaccines](http://www.historyofvaccines.org/)** - [The College of Physicians of Philadelphia](http://www.collegeofphysicians.org/)
  *The History of Vaccines* is an award-winning informational, educational website created by The College of Physicians of Philadelphia, one of the oldest medical societies in the United States. A group of prominent Philadelphia physicians, including Declaration of Independence signer Benjamin Rush, established the College in 1787 "to advance the science of medicine and to thereby lessen human misery."
- **[Vaccines](http://www.redwineandapplesauce.com/vaccines/)** - [Red Wine & Apple Sauce](http://www.redwineandapplesauce.com/) (blog), By Tara Haelle
  Tara Haelle writes a lot about vaccines, and hersite has become a resource for many seeking answers about vaccines because she tries to be very conscientious about linking to original studies and transparent about the known risks of vaccination, creating a resource page for new visitors.
- **[Vaccines — Calling the Shots](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/body/vaccines-calling-shots.html)** - TV Program (53:10), [PBS](http://www.pbs.org/) [NOVA](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/)
  Diseases that were largely eradicated in the United States a generation ago — whooping cough, measles, mumps — are returning, in part because nervous parents are skipping their children's shots. NOVA's "Vaccines — Calling the Shots" takes viewers around the world to track epidemics, explore the science behind vaccinations, hear from parents wrestling with vaccine-related questions, and shed light on the risks of opting out.
- **[Vaccines and Herd Immunity](http://rocs.hu-berlin.de/D3/herd/)** - [Research on Complex Systems](http://rocs.hu-berlin.de/)
  When a person vaccinates against an infectious disease this not only protects that person. The acquired immunity is also beneficial to the rest of population because the immunized person can no longer be a potential transmitter. This cumulative social effect is known as herd immunity. Herd immunity implies that a disease can be eradicated if the fraction of the population that is immune exceeds a critical value.
- **[Vaccines & Immunizations](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/index.html)** - [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention](https://www.cdc.gov/)
  Learn about protecting your child from infectious diseases, vaccine requirements for day care and school; vaccines you need determined by your age, lifestyle, health conditions, job, international travel; Learn how staying up to date on your vaccinations is all part of a healthy pregnancy, and much more.
- **[Vaccine Safety: Examine the Evidence](https://www.aap.org/en-us/Documents/immunization_vaccine_studies.pdf)** - [American Academy of Pediatrics](https://www.aap.org/)
  The safety and effectiveness of vaccines are under constant study. Because vaccines are designed to be given routinely during well-child care visits, they must be extraordinarily safe. Safety testing begins as soon as a new vaccine is contemplated, continues until it is approved by the FDA, and is monitored indefinitely after licensure. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) works closely with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to make recommendations for vaccine use. Please examine the evidence for yourself. If you have any questions, speak with your pediatrician.
