#Our Mission
SALI brings together scientists and supporters of science from all backgrounds to advocate for scientific education and legislation and to encourage public engagement with science.

Working at local, state, and federal levels, our goals are to:

Champion health and environmental policies supported by evidence-based science.
Help secure funding and other resources for science education and scientific research.
Promote and safeguard scientific integrity and ethics.
To accomplish these goals, we will develop and promote initiatives that will educate and engage the general public, students, and the scientific community on health, environmental, and science policy issues.
