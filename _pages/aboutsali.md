## <u>Our Mission</u>
SALI brings together scientists and supporters of science from all backgrounds to promote scientific communication and encourage public engagement with science

## <u>Vision Statement</u>

Our goals are to: 

1. Provide a reliable and trusted resource for scientific information for the local community.
2. Advocate for evidence-based policies locally and advance scientific education.

To this end, we will buildup our online presence where we create content, share scientifically vetted information, amplify other scientists and science communicators, and continue outreach into the community. We will bring together voices from the scientific community to create spaces for public forums (virtual or in-person) on relevant scientific topics that impact the Long Island community and the community at-large, and support and promote policies by local lawmakers that are evidence-based.

## <u>Meet the Team</u>
### Dr. Miriam R. Fein

***Founder & Executive Director***

![image-left](/assets/images/biophotos/MiriamFein.png){: .align-left} Miriam earned her undergraduate degree from Queens College (CUNY) in Biology (2003), her Masterâ€™s degree from Hunter College (CUNY) in Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology (2006), and completed her Ph.D. at Stony Brook University in Genetics (2016) under the guidance of Dr. Mikala Egeblad at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory (CSHL). There, she discovered a novel mechanism of immune suppression in breast cancer, whereby CCR2 signaling in cancer cells suppresses immune control of tumors, in part by reducing CD103+ dendritic cell recruitment ([Cancer cell CCR2 orchestrates suppression of the adaptive immune response](https://rupress.org/jem/article/217/10/e20181551/151949/Cancer-cell-CCR2-orchestrates-suppression-of-the)). She served as the Reviews Editor at *Genes & Development* at CSHL Press before going back to the bench as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the lab of Dr. Semir Beyaz (CSHL), investigating the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which diet-induced obesity promotes cancer progression by altering the immune system. Miriam founded Science Advocacy of Long Island (SALI) in 2017, and is passionate about science communication and policy. Miriam lives in Plainview with her three children, Esther, Ezra, and Tehila. She is an avid trail runner who loves to run ultra-distances, and has completed races up to 100 miles. 

### Jeremiah Bautista

***Director of Technology and Multimedia Communications***

![image-right](/assets/images/biophotos/JeremiahBautista.png){: .align-right} Jeremiah earned his B.A. from [Stony Brook University](http://www.stonybrook.edu/) in Economics. While not a true science, economics is often referred to  as the "dismal science" by those who study it. Jeremiah first became of a fan of science when he and his family would watch the original Star Trek TV series as well as Star Trek: The Next Generation. The setting of those shows, a utopian society that humanity achieved through their understanding of the sciences, is something that still resonates with him today. He currently works as the sole Systems Administrator for several medical practices. In his spare time you will likely find him running the beautiful trails throughout New York.

### Sharon Becker  

***Volunteer***

She enjoys working as an advocate on public policy issues.  Working with SALI enables her to combine her  past experiences working in the Massachusetts Senate and private sector. Sharon has a BS in Marketing from the [University of Massachusetts](https://www.massachusetts.edu/) and a JD from the [Western New England University School of Law](http://www1.wne.edu/law/). She is admitted to the [MA state bar](https://www.massbar.org/).

### Jeanette Hafke

***Volunteer***

![image-right](/assets/images/biophotos/JeanetteHafke.png){: .align-right} Jeanette earned her BFA in Graphic Design in 1992 from [School of Visual Arts (SVA)](https://www.sva.edu/). Along the way, she stumbled into web design and development due to a  chance conversation with an Anime distributor at I-CON. With  encouragement from her brother-in-law and a lot of self-teaching, this  passion evolved into an online career spanning nearly two decades.  Jeanette has worked at [CMP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CMP_Technology) and [UBM](http://www.ubm.com) as a web producer, designer and front-end developer ([InformationWeek.com](https://www.informationweek.com), [DarkReading.com](https://www.darkreading.com/), Optimize.com, WinMag.com, and more), was an internal communications intranet and newsletter consultant for [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com)'s North America Marketing team, and currently is a web producer, article PDF producer, and enewsletter consultant for the [Bridgespan Group](https://www.bridgespan.org/), as well as working as a web producer, directory researcher, and social media consultant for [Mulesoft](https://www.mulesoft.com)'s [*ProgrammableWeb*.com](https://www.ProgrammableWeb.com/). She also assists several clients with production, design, development,  and hosting on a variety of smaller sites. Jeanette loves to champion a  good cause and has always loved science. She is married and lives in  East Meadow with her two children Timothy and Sarah, and her very large  Lab-Dane mix, KitKat. When not behind the keyboard, she is an avid  crocheter, DIYer, and maker.

### Dr. Anna Li

***Volunteer***

![image-left](/assets/images/biophotos/AnnaLi.png){: .align-left} Anna went to [Stony Brook University](http://www.stonybrook.edu/) for a BS in biology, and [Ross University School of Medicine](https://medical.rossu.edu/) for a MD. "I try my best with tweeting different kinds of #scicomm  messages on the SALI twitter handle. Between new scientific findings and exploring the different ways scientific research is important to  everyone, there's a lot to choose from. I think that with such an  abundance of riches, a lot can get lost for people without a scientific  background. The 280 character limit is a perfect way to get everyone  interested."

### Dr. Robert Wysocki

***Volunteer***

![image-right](/assets/images/biophotos/RobertWysocki.png){: .align-right} Bobby earned his undergraduate degree from [Hamilton College](https://www.hamilton.edu/) in Biochemistry/Molecular Biology in 2007.
